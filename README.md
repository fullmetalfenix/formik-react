# Trying our Formik for building Forms in React

Formik is supposed to assist with value/state in a React form, errors, visited fields validation (and more) all of which is kind of a pain when working from scratch so it looks interesting! Also, aside from being presented as simple to use, it's built to be lightweight and preformant so sounds great!

## Set up from the tutorial
 Following the local setup of the tutorial listed (https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/tutorial)[here]
  - Set up with create-react-app, I think you can skip the copy/paste of the tik-tack-toe game to try out the CRA setup but whatever you want to do. 

## Copy / Paste the first demo form
  - OK, looking good, no real effort on state management on my part, seems to be a few helpers returned from the useFormik hook and its displaying an alert - looks good so far - under the form it clues you in a bit to whats going on here, great.
